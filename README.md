This machine learning project is integrated with frontend, to run this project follow bellow steps :
1. app.py file is the backend machine learning code
2. index.html is the frontend code which includes(html,css,javascript)
3. In this project, i have merged two projects (Typo-terminator and NextWord_predictions) and developed this project.
4. Typo-terminator code is directly integrated in the backend code but NextWord_prediction code has to be train seperately so that i provide code for the  NextWord_prediction, train the model in keras.
5. |-->And import that model and pickel files to the existing project files.
